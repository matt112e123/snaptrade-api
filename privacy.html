<h1>Privacy Policy <span class="tag">Effective September 11, 2025</span></h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Elite Pictures LLC (d/b/a “Apex Markets”)</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you visit <a href="https://www.theapexinvestor.com">https://www.theapexinvestor.com</a> or use <strong>Apex</strong> (together, the “Service”). If you use MoonPay to buy or sell digital assets or to complete identity verification, MoonPay will also process your information in accordance with MoonPay’s own terms and privacy policy. Where MoonPay determines the purposes and means of processing (e.g., KYC/AML checks), MoonPay acts as an <strong>independent controller</strong> of your personal data.</p>

<h2>1) Who we are</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Legal entity: <strong>Elite Pictures LLC (d/b/a “Apex Markets”)</strong></li>
  <li>Address: <code class="tbd">[ADD COMPANY ADDRESS]</code></li>

  <li>General contact: <a href="mailto:info@elitepictures.co">info@elitepictures.co</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
<p><strong>Information you provide:</strong> account and contact details; identity/verification data for compliance (e.g., ID documents, selfies) provided directly to MoonPay when required; transaction info; communications you send us. We do not store full payment credentials; these are handled by payment partners (e.g., MoonPay).</p>
<p><strong>Information collected automatically:</strong> device and usage data (IP, device identifiers, browser, OS, pages viewed, timestamps), cookies and similar technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Information from third parties:</strong> payment/verification status and risk signals from partners such as MoonPay (e.g., payment success/failure, verification outcome, fraud flags) to the extent needed to deliver the Service and meet legal obligations.</p>

<h3>Non‑custodial keys</h3>
<p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or have access to your private keys or secret recovery phrases. These remain encrypted on your device and are never transmitted to our servers.</p>

<h3>Public blockchain data</h3>
<p>Public blockchain data (e.g., wallet addresses, transaction hashes, token/NFT metadata) is accessible to anyone. We may read or derive insights from this public data to provide features (balances, history, quotes, risk/fraud checks) but we do <strong>not</strong> attempt to deanonymize on‑chain activity beyond what is necessary for fraud prevention, abuse mitigation, legal compliance, or to provide requested features.</p>

<h2>California Notice at Collection (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>

Code §1798.140, including: Identifiers; Customer Records; Commercial Information; Internet/Network Activity; Geolocation (approximate); Professional Information (if provided); Inferences. Sensitive Personal Information (SPI): we do not seek SPI. If identity documents/biometrics are required for KYC/AML, these are processed by MoonPay and/or verification partners for compliance. We do not use SPI to infer characteristics or for cross‑context behavioral advertising.</p>

  <li><strong>Your rights:</strong> know/access, correct, delete, data portability, limit SPI, non‑discrimination; may use an authorized agent.</li>
  <li><strong>How to exercise:</strong> email <a href="mailto:privacy@theapexinvestor.com">privacy@theapexinvestor.com</a> or submit at <code class="tbd">[ADD DATA REQUEST FORM LINK]</code>.

<h2>4) Sharing of information</h2>

<h2>5) IP addresses & advertising</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use IP addresses for advertising or cross‑context behavioral targeting, and our systems are not designed to associate IP addresses with identifiers such as wallet addresses, usernames, or emails.</p>

<h2>6) International transfers</h2>
<p>If we transfer your data outside your country, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) as required by law.</p>

<h2>7) Data retention</h2>

<h2>8) Your rights</h2>
<p>California (CCPA/CPRA): see the Notice at Collection above. EEA/UK users may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port data, and to object to certain processing. Withdraw consent where applicable. You can lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

<h2>9) Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>10) Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>11) Cookies and tracking</h2>
<p>We use cookies for essential functionality, analytics, and (if applicable) advertising. Where required, we obtain your consent via a cookie banner. You can manage cookies in your browser settings.</p>
